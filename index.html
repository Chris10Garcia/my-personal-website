                    <p>Hello, my name is Christian, and welcome to my webpage! I am a prospective student for the Flatiron Software Development Bootcamp. I start January 9th, and I am very excited to start my new journey to become a software developer. I will be doing this program part-time and online, and I am expected to graduate in October 2023.</p>

                    <p>I created this site to submit as my final pre work project. Below is a brief description of my background, goals, and why I want to switch careers. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through!</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I’ve always had an affinity towards engineering. I was part of a robotics team in high school and did SAE Baja for 2 years during my time at Stony Brook University (image of SBU logo). I graduated with my Bachelor’s of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering and ended up at The Dow Chemical Company as my first career out of college. After 1.5 years, I switched companies and ended up back in New York City through the MTA New York City Transit. I’ve been with the MTA for 9 years as a mechanical engineer for the Bus Department (transit logo).</p>

                    <h2 class="subheader" id="journey">My Journey Transitioning into Tech</h2>
                </button>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Throughout my career at the MTA, I dabbled with coding and software development. I developed an interest and aptitude for using coding to automate some of my work (macros for excel). After a few years within transit, I decided to prioritize learning software development and making an attempt to switch careers. I wanted a career where teamwork, proactive approaches, and collaboration was supported. I wanted a job where problem solving with creative solutions is encouraged. The bus engineering department at the MTA is not the best career for engineers.(image: reactive / proactive) There are constant “fires” that are solely prioritized, there are many silo’s within the department, and teamwork between the groups is discouraged. This department is more of a place to relax, retire, or do the bare minimum while having a second job. And this is not what I want for a career.</p>
                    <p>I originally planned on quitting after I hit my five year mark. I had researched Flatiron and was going to go full time. Unfortunately, this was around March 2020, right when COVID crippled the world and various lockdowns occurred (image: covid shutdown / pandemic spread readed). Many industries had shut down, and a number of businesses unfortunately went under. All of my close friends and colleagues highly advised against me quitting my safe, stable government job to go back to school during this highly volatile time. Of course hindsight is 20-20; those that were laid off went back to school and are now doing better for themselves compared to precovid times. I felt I made the right decision staying during the pandemic, however I was now approaching the 10 year mark at the MTA. This is significant because my pension would become vested and there were other benefits I would receive regardless if I left transit after 10 years.</p>
                    <p>So now that I have been with the MTA for 9 years, I plan on doing the 10 month online part-time software development bootcamp with the Flatiron School. By the time I graduate, my pension would be vested, and I can leave transit with a new career while still retaining a number of benefits from the MTA.</p>

                    <p>I hope to graduate from Flatiron and switch to a more fulfilling career into tech! I want a career where collaboration and teamwork is encouraged. I want a career where people are inspired and motivated to work, think outside of the box, and proactively solve problems. And I want a career that provides me a sense of satisfaction with the work and projects I will be completing. I am not sure which industry I want to dive into; healthcare, finance, a tech company, or something else, but I feel any of those would fulfill my career needs while providing great benefits, pay, and work life balance.</p>
